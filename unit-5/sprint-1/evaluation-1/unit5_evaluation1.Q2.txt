Q2 : a) What is normalization and why is it needed?
        b) What is the 2NF? Explain with an example. You don’t need to draw the tables or write
       the queries. Just mention the schema before and after the second normal form.



ANS A):  NORMALIZATION:- It is process in which we organise the data in our database to avoid duplicasy and some Anomalies,like insertion anamoly ,update anomaly and delete anamoly;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ANS B): 2NF  :- it is known as Second normal form.
			A table is said to be in second normal only if following conditon is true;
			
			1:-Table is in first Normal form;
			2:- nON prime attributes should not be dependent on the subset of candidate key


  Explain with an example. You don’t need to draw the tables or write
       the queries. Just mention the schema before and after the second normal form.

 CREATE TABLE SCHEMA.Employees((EmpId varchar(5) Primary KEY,ProjId varchar(5) UNIQUE KEY, EmpName varchar(15), ProjName        varchar(20));

As you can see in the upper table it is following 1NF but violating 2NF, because there Non-Prime attributes are partially dependent on the Candidate key,
but we need fully dpendencies.

So, Lets convert this table in 2NF.
CREATE TABLE SCHEMA.Employee_Details(EmpID varchar(5) PRIMARY KEY, ProjId varchar(5) FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES(ProjectInfo), EmpName varhcar(20));
CREATE TABLE SCEHMA.ProjectInfo(ProjId varhcar(5) PRIMARY KEY, ProjName varchar(20));

As you can see now from the schema itself our both Non-Prime attributes are fully dependent on Prime attribute(Candidate Keys), So now the data is is in 2NF.
