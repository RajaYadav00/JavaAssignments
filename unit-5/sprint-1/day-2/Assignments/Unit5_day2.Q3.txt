Q 3 Explain what is a PK, Candidate Key, Prime Attributes, Non-prime Attributes ?

ans:
          PRIMARY KEY:  It is an attribute of the column in SQL which is unique
                                   and can not have a null value;
                                    A Table can have only one primary key;

           CANDIDATE KEY: the attribute of the column which can be defined as the primary key is a candidate key
                                       1- every primary key is a candidate key but vice-versa is not true;  
                                       2- candidate key column can have a null value;
                                        3- it also identifies uniquely in a table;

             PRIME ATTRIBUTES: the column which can be defined as candidate keys known as prime attributes  
                                 example:roll_No,email_is;

            NON-PRIME ATTRIBUTES:-The Attribute of column which can not defined as candidate key are known as Non-prime Attribute
                                    Examle:name,age,City;
