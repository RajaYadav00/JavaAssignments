STATIC VARIABLES
   1:- All static variables are loaded in RAM first.
   2:-We can access static variables anywhere;
   3:-static variable can be accessed with or without the object.
      i.e. static variables can be used anywhere in the class
   4:- since they are loaded in RAM they will be available for the CPU to execute;
   
 NON STATIC VARIABLES
    1:- All non-static variables present in hard-disk in the form of bytecode;
    2:- they are not accessible from static fields.  
    3:-they are not loaded into the RAM initially. so they are not available to the CPU for the execution.
    4:-We need to create an object to use a non-static variable.
       after creating an object they available in heap memory
