         PLATEFORM INDEPENDENT
         
   Plate form independent means a program can run on any platform ;
   Java is a plate form independent programming language .because of JDK JRE JVM.
   
   How does java manage platform-independent?
   
   The program written in java is stored in a .java file which is the source code.
   the .java file is converted into a .class file in the form of bytecode by compiler which is in JDK.
   the byte-code can be executed by JVM on any operating system where JRE(jvm) is installed.
   
   																	   run		
   .JAVA(source-code)----->compiler---->.Class(byte-code)-------->JVM--------------->output
         												 (at any operating system)
   
   
   this whole things make java platform independent.
