1) String :- String java is a class belong to java.lang package.this string class use to create string object;

2)StringBuffer:-since string is immutable .we can not change the string but in java with help of stringBuffer we can make it mutable;

      String other=new String(str);
      
3)StrigBuilder:-we can also make our string mutablbe with help of stringBulider;


4)toString():- when we try to print inctance of a variable in java it calles the toString method  witch by default prind (class name @ has code);
               we can override toString method to print desired output;
               
               @Override
				   public String toString() {
					    String str="my name raja";
				     return str;
				   }
