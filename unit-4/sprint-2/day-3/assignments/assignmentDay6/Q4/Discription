What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keyword in java explain with example.


THIS KEY WORD: It points to current object.
                when we want to point an object from method which is under execution because of the dame
                object we use this keyword.
                
                MAIN WORK OF THIS KEY WORD:
                1) point to the current object.
                2)differentiate between local and instance variable.
                3)Calling a constructor of a class from another constructor of the same class.
              


SUPER KEY WORD : the super key word in java is a reference variable that is used to refer the immediate 
                  parent class object.
                  when we create the object of a subclass,an object of parent class is created implicitly
                  which is referred by the super reference variable.
                  
                  USES OF SUPER KEYWORD:
                  1)super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class object/instance variable.
                  2)super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
                  3)super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
                  
                 example:
                 class A{
                     String color="red";
                  }
                  class B{
                   	String color="green";
                   	
                   	void printcolor(){
                     	System.out.println(color);//print green color
                   	     System.out.println(super.color);//print red color
                   	   }
                   	 }
                   	 class Main{
                   	 public static void main(String args[]){
                   	     
                   	 			A obj=new A();
                   	 			obj.printcolor();
                   	 }
