    Explain about an abstract method and an abstract class with an example.
    
    Abstraction means hiding the implememtaation details and showing only functionality;
    
    Abstract class:-
    
     To make a class to behave as abstract class we need to declare it as (abstract class.) 
     A abstract class may have abstract and non abstract method.
     It need to be extend and its abstract method shoud be overriden;
     It can not be instanciated.
     
     IMPORTENT POINTS OF ABSTRACT CLASS:
     
     1:-it should be declared with abstract keyword.
     2:-it can have abstract or non abstract method.
     3:-it can have constructor and static method also.
     4:-it can have final method which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
     
     
     Abstract Method :-
        If we want only method declaration in super class than we have to use abstract key word as access-modifire.
        this method is sometime called as subclass responsibility.because they have no method body in super-class.Thus
        a subclass must override them to privide method body or definition
        
                 abstract type method-name(parameter-list);
                 
        Any concrete class that extends an abstract class must override all the abstract methods of the class.         
        
     ABSTRACT METHOD IMPORTENT POINTS
     1:- They only have method signature not the method body.
     2:- We can not write a abstract method in concrete class.i.e. only abstract class can have abstract method.
     3:- ILLIGAL COMBINATIONS
           1:-	final-abstract
           b:-  abstract static
           c:-  abstract private    
           
           
           
       example:-
       
       public abstract class Example{
       		
       		abstract void getvalue();
       }
