  INTER THREAD COMMUNICATION OR THREAD-SYNCHRONIZATION
  
  
  The thread which are synchronize can communicate with each other using some method
   which are present in Object class those method are wait(),notify()and notifyAll();
   
   Using these method we can achieve partial level of control over thread scheduler which is
   responsible for giving time to particular thread;
   
  To call wait or notify()  method on any object we must have that particular object lock  other wise we get an exception called illegalMonitorstateexcaption;
   wait()    :--
   ----------      when we need to suspend a synchronized thread unconditionally then we use wait();
                        
   						once thread call wait() method on any object it release the lock first of that object and get in waiting state immediately;
   						
     
     Notify()   :-- once thread calls notify method on any object class it also releases the lock of that object but not immediately.
     -------------
     
     
     Wait and notify or notifyAll method belongs to Object class because a thread call these method on any java object.						
     
     
     NOTE :-- WE CAN CALL WAIT NOTIFY AND NOTIFYALL  IN SYNCHRONIZE BLOCK OR METHOD ONLY OTHER WISE IT WILL WE WILL GET RUNTIME EXCEPTION;
